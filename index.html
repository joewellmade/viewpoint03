        <p>"I had the great fortune of engaging Viewpoint as my management accountants after 18 months trading, by which point my total ignorance of accounting and financial management had left my business in complete chaos. Viewpoint not only worked tirelessly with me to turn the business around, but have in the intervening 5 years been a constant source of support, advice and elucidation. I could not conceive of being here without them."</p>
